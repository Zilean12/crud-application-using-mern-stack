## Database Relationships

Unlock the intricacies of our MongoDB database relationships:

## One-to-One

Each user in the system has a detail record associated with them. This is a one-to-one relationship. In MongoDB, this is typically modeled by embedding the detail document inside the user document.

## One-to-Many

Each user can have multiple phone numbers. This is a one-to-many relationship. In MongoDB, this is typically modeled by embedding an array of phone number documents inside the user document.

## Many-to-Many

Users can have multiple hobbies or skills, and each hobby or skill can be associated with multiple users. This is a many-to-many relationship. In MongoDB, this is typically modeled by using an array of references to the related documents. For example, each user document could have an array of references to the hobby documents that are associated with that user.
